# InsanitySweeper
A Minesweeper Game Designed for Large Boards and Multiplayer Play

I'm back working on this project, in another branch. The main goals currently are:
-Fix Long Standing Bugs
-Make game more playable (Add things like UI Scaling)
-Optimize Save Game Format
-Comment code and make it prettier.
