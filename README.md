# InsanitySweeper
A Minesweeper Game Designed for Large Boards and Multiplayer Play

I'm back working on this project, in another branch. This is the last of the "Alpha" builds. The game is now in
a playable enough state to be moved into beta. Alpha supports UI Scaling, Optimized Saving, and some bugfixes from the
original release. Keep a Look out for the first beta uploads, as those will include a UI and Rendering overhaul.
