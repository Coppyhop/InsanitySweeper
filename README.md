# InsanitySweeper
A Minesweeper Game Designed for Large Boards and Multiplayer Play

This is a pull from masater of the last alpha build. As I plan on re-working the render engine completely in the future to use OpenGL 3.3+, it seemed logical to put the OpenGL 1.1 Stuff in its own branch. This is for the people still stuck in the past, wasn't OpenGL 1.1 deprecated a really long time ago? OpenGL 3.3 Hardwares like 10 years old Upgrade damnit! This branch will not be updated at all, the new UI enchancements, Rendering Optimizations, and Gameplay changes will not come to this branch.
